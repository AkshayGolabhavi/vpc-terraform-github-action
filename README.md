![Project Flow](https://github.com/gauri17-pro/vpc-terraform-github-actions/assets/60473255/0e09102c-2949-4576-be43-39900a2c1a95)
 
 ## Introduction 
 This GitHub project provides a comprehensive guide and a set of resources to create and manage infrastructure using Terraform and automate the deployment process using GitHub Actions. 
 
 Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. 
 
 Whereas GitHub Actions is a powerful automation and CI/CD platform provided by GitHub.

 
By combining Terraform and GitHub Actions, you can:

**Define Infrastructure as Code**: Define your infrastructure components, such as virtual machines, databases, and networks, in a Terraform configuration file.

**Automate Deployment**: Set up GitHub Actions workflows to automatically deploy your infrastructure whenever there are changes to your Terraform configuration.

**Version Control**: Keep your infrastructure code version-controlled and easily collaborate with your team.

**Infrastructure as Code Best Practices**: Follow best practices for infrastructure as code, including versioning, code review, and documentation.

This project serves as a starting point for your infrastructure automation journey, providing a basic structure and guidelines to build upon.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

* GitHub Account
* Terraform installed on your local machine.
* Access to a cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and necessary API credentials.

Steps for Commands
1) First clone the existing repo
2) Create feature branch VS Code >> git checkout -b 'feature'
3) Then Edit as per your requement and save all the files
4) VS Code >> git status
5) VS Code >> git add .
6) VS Code>> git commint -m "privide msg as poer your need" (like build infra or destroy infra)
7) VS Code >> git push -u origin feature

Note: VS Code Means (Visual studio code terminal you have to run all above commands)

Go to github GUI and accept all the pull request and marge feature branch to main branch. Once you clicked "confirm marge" then follow the below the step. 
Go to action and check pipeline is running fine or not.


Thank You!
